# Gold Quest Game

## Game Rules

* There are 3 types of pieces on the board: Two player pieces (red and blue), and coins
* On their turn, a player moves one of their pieces to an adjacent empty cell on the board (adjacent being top, left, right or bottom)
* Coins switch to either blue or red piece if surrounded by that color from two adjacent sides 
* A player piece surrounded by two adjacent opponent pieces gets "captured"
* Captured pieces are removed from board
* Pieces that reach the opposite end row will be "frozen" (can't be moved anymore, and can't be used to catch opponent pieces) and count towards the player score
* When all pieces of any player are captured and/or reach end row the game is over 
* Player with most pieces on the board wins
* Game ends when both players played same number of moves or when both players have no more free pieces 
* A player wins when all their pieces are captured and their frozen and active are more than the opponent frozen pieces
* A player also wins when all their pieces are frozen and are more than the opponent frozen pieces, even if the opponent still has free pieces
* A player also wins if all opponent pieces are trapped (completely surrounded by opponent pieces)
